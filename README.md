# CV-parser
CV-parser is a simple and lightweight cli application that helps you compile different variations of the same Curriculum Vitae / Resum√© with ease.

It is very easy to work with since you just need to provide 2 different files that can be easily edited with any text editor.
You will need:

   - JSON file that contains the data that you want to populate your resume with.
   - Template file written in basic HTML that has the same variables that you specified in the JSON file. 

After running CV-parser and specifying such files; the application will replace the keys in the template with the corresponding data.

# Why is this useful?

Well it is useful in my case for 2 specific reasons:
1. I don't like using word processors. They get messy and I find way easier to customize and edit a HTML + CSS file. ( It is also free to use )
2. I have to generate different variations of the same CV ofent and editing is way easier with a text/code editor. I am multilingual so I will have to create several versions of the same curriculum.

# How to use:

First of all you will need to have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your machine.

Then just clone this repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ryuu22/CV-parser.git
```
